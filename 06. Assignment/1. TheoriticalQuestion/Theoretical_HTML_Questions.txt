Q1. What is HTML? Explain its purpose in web development.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages. It defines the structure of a webpage using a series of elements (tags) and is used to organize content, such as text, images, and videos, on the web.
Purpose in web development:
- Provides structure for content (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.).
- Embeds multimedia (images, videos, audio).
- Enables navigation with links.
- Serves as the foundation for styling (CSS) and scripting (JavaScript).

Q2. What are semantic HTML elements? Provide examples of three semantic tags and explain their significance.
Semantic HTML elements clearly define their purpose and meaning, improving accessibility, SEO, and code readability.
Examples:
- <header>: Represents the header of a page or section.
- <article>: Represents an independent block of content.
- <footer>: Represents the footer of a page or section.
Significance:
- Enhances SEO by providing structured content.
- Improves accessibility for assistive technologies.
- Makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Q3. What is the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples.
- Block-level elements: Occupy the full width of the parent container and start on a new line.
  Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>.
- Inline elements: Occupy only as much width as their content and do not start on a new line.
  Examples: <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>.

Q4. What is the purpose of the <meta> tag in HTML? How is it commonly used?
The <meta> tag provides metadata about an HTML document, which is not displayed directly on the page.
Common uses:
- Character encoding: <meta charset="UTF-8">
- Viewport settings for responsiveness: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
- SEO optimization: <meta name="description" content="This is a web development blog.">

Q5. What is the Document Object Model (DOM), and how does it relate to HTML?
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects, where each node corresponds to an element in the HTML document.
Relation to HTML:
- The DOM allows developers to manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a webpage dynamically using JavaScript.

Q6. Explain the difference between <div> and <span> elements in HTML. When would you use each?
- <div>: A block-level element used to group and structure content.
  Use case: Dividing sections of a webpage (e.g., main content, sidebar).
  Example:
  <div>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
  </div>
- <span>: An inline element used to style or group small parts of text or content.
  Use case: Styling specific text within a paragraph.
  Example:
  <p>This is a <span style="color: red;">highlighted</span> word.</p>

Q7. What is the purpose of the alt attribute in the <img> tag? Why is it important for accessibility and SEO?
The alt attribute provides alternative text for an image.
Importance:
- Accessibility: Helps visually impaired users understand the image through screen readers.
- SEO: Search engines index the alternative text, improving the page's visibility in search results.
- Fallback: Displays text if the image fails to load.

Q8. What are HTML attributes, and how do they modify elements?
Attributes provide additional information about an element and modify its behavior or appearance.
Example:
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
- href: Specifies the URL.
- target: Opens the link in a new tab.

Q9. Give an example of an HTML tag with attributes.
Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="500" height="300">
Attributes:
- src: Specifies the image source.
- alt: Provides alternative text for accessibility.
- width and height: Define the dimensions.

Q10. What is the difference between an absolute URL and a relative URL in HTML? Provide an example of each.
- Absolute URL: A full web address, including the protocol (e.g., https://).
  Example:
  <a href="https://example.com/page.html">Visit Page</a>
- Relative URL: Refers to a path relative to the current document's location.
  Example:
  <a href="/page.html">Visit Page</a>
